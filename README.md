## jhenkens Fork
I used CoPilot to rewrite it using python... then further modified it to actually work in python (copilot can only do so much!). I'm sure it'd work in bash, but I just didn't want to use the dind pattern. 

I haven't migrated some features (see note below), but the fork does not require read-write docker-socket permissions, only read. It doesn't perform the upnpc action via "forking" new docker containers that run upnpc, it uses python miniupnpc directly.

I did some change to it to use TTL's so that the rules expire quickly if the container dies, but the container renews them automatically (requires a delete-add to refresh the TTL). It'd be easy to add a delete-before-stop hook to the sigterm handling.

### Not implemented features:
1. Docker event streaming - we poll so frequently, I'm not sure its necessary. It doesn't really work with the concept of the TTL's super well, because we'd still need to scan on startup to gather all the TTLs, and trust nothing else has changed, and trigger timer events to update them via TTL.
2. MACVlan/IPVlan LAN IP discovery - wouldn't be too hard I don't think, I just don't use those and didn't need it for my WIP.
3. Passing the UPnP connection url directly rather than discovery. Couldn't get this to work via upnpc or python-miniupnp.

# Portical

## Overview
Portical is a docker container designed to manage UPnP port forwarding rules for Docker containers. 
It allows users to set up port forwarding just by setting a single label on their container.
It was inspired by [Traefik Proxy](https://traefik.io/traefik/) autoconfiguration of HTTP port forwarding rules.

## Requirements
- Some Docker containers you want to expose to the internet
- UPnP-enabled internet gateway (tested on Google Nest Wifi)

## Usage
There are 2 parts to Portical:

1. Add the `portical.upnp.forward` label and rules (`published`, `8080:80/tcp`, `8080:80` or `8080`, `8080/up` etc) to your Docker containers to expose them to the internet.
2. Run Portical container to set up port forwarding rules and monitor as many containers as you want.

### Part 1: Adding the `portical.upnp.forward` label

The label `portical.upnp.forward` is used to specify the port forwarding rules in the following format 
`${external_port}:${internal_port}/${optional-protocol}`. 

#### Examples
- `published` will forward port all ports that have been published on the host. This is useful for containers that use the default `bridge` network driver and reduces duplication.
- `9999:8000/tcp` will forward port `9999` on internet gateway to the docker network's port `8000` using only the TCP protocol.
- `25565:25565` will forward port `25565` on internet gateway to the docker network's port `25565` using both TCP and UDP protocol.
- `19132:19132/udp` will forward port `19132` on internet gateway to the docker network's port `19132` using only the UDP protocol.
- `19132/udp,8080/tcp` will forward port two ports UDP port `19132` and TCP port `8080`.

Lets see what that looks like in practice:

**Docker**:

```shell
# Forward port 9999 on your router to port 8888 on the docker host then to port 80 on the container (for illustration purposes)
docker run nginx:latest \
 --label portical.upnp.forward=9999:8888 
 -p 8888:80
```

**Docker Compose**:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  nginx: 
    image: 'nginx:latest'
    ports: 
      - '8888:80'
    labels:
      - 'portical.upnp.forward=9999:8888'
```

### Part 2: Running Portical

Next we need to run Portical to set up the port forwarding rules and keep them up to date.

#### Overview

- **Commands**:
   - `poll`: Continuously updates port forwarding rules at specified intervals.
   - `update`: Finds containers with the specified label and sets up port forwarding once only.  (mainly for testing)
     - Warning UPnP rules expire.

- **Options (all optional)**:
   - `-r`, `--root [URL]`: Set the UPnP root URL. (use if autodiscovery does not work)
   - `-d`, `--duration [SECONDS]`: Set the polling interval in seconds (default: `15` seconds).
   - `-l`, `--label [LABEL]`: Specify the Docker label to filter containers (default: `portical.upnp.forward`.
   - `-v`, `--verbose`: Enable verbose output.
   - `-f`, `--force`: Remove existing rules even if they match (will disconnect any active connections).

- **Environment Variables**:
   - `PORTICAL_UPNP_ROOT_URL`: The root URL for the UPnP device.
   - `PORTICAL_POLL_INTERVAL`: Interval in seconds for polling and updating rules (default: 15 seconds).

### Docker

To get started it is recommended to run Portical with the `update` command to check it can either autodiscover your 
internet gateway or you can specify the root URL. Auto discovery is the default behaviour but can be very slow, so it may
be more practical to specify the root URL.

#### Run Once with Autodiscovery (for testing)

```shell
docker run --rm -v '/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock' \
  danielbodart/portical:latest /opt/portical/run -v update
```

This will use autodiscovery to find your internet gateway. 

#### Run Once with explicit root URL

If autodiscovery does not work, you can specify the UPnP root 
URL using the `-r` or `--root` option:

```shell
docker run --rm -v '/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock' \
  danielbodart/portical:latest /opt/portical/run \
  -r "http://internal-gateway-ip:5000/somePath.xml" update
```

#### Poll and Demonise

```shell
docker run --rm -d -v '/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock' \
  danielbodart/portical:latest /opt/portical/run poll
```

This will use autodiscovery to find your internet gateway.

#### Poll and Demonise with explicit root URL

If autodiscovery does not work, you can specify the UPnP root
URL using the `-r` or `--root` option:

```shell
docker run --rm -d -v '/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock' \
  danielbodart/portical:latest /opt/portical/run \
  -r "http://internal-gateway-ip:5000/somePath.xml" poll
```


### Docker Compose Setup (Recommended)

The ideal solution is to use Docker Compose to run Portical and your other containers in all one place:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:

  portical:
    image: 'danielbodart/portical:latest'
    environment:
      - PORTICAL_UPNP_ROOT_URL=http://internal-gateway-ip:5000/somePath.xml # Optional
    volumes:
      - '/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock' # Required
    restart: unless-stopped
    network_mode: host
    command: "/opt/portical/run poll" # Change default "listen" command to "poll". It checks every "${PORTICAL_POLL_INTERVAL}" seconds
                                      # for running containers with "portical.upnp.forward" label and "renew" the forward

  # This is a service we are going to expose to the internet (for illustration purposes only)
  minecraft_java: 
    image: 'gameservermanagers/gameserver:mc'
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports: 
      - '25565:25565' # This is the port that will be exposed on the host (when in bridge network mode)
    labels:
    - 'portical.upnp.forward=published' # This will forward 25565 to 25565 on the container (see ports section)
    depends_on:
      - portical # Wait for "portical" container to be up and running

  # This is another service we are going to expose to the internet (for illustration purposes only)
  nginx: 
    image: 'nginx:latest'
    restart: unless-stopped
    network_mode: custom_network # This is a custom network (could be macvlan or ipvlan), notice no ports are needed
    labels:
      - 'portical.upnp.forward=8000:80/tcp' # This will forward port 8000 on the internet gateway to port 80 on the container on its custom network
    depends_on:
      - portical # Wait for "portical" container to be up and running
```


## How it Works

The Portical container does the following steps:
1. Uses Docker's API (via  `/var/run/docker.sock`) to find containers with the specified label `portical.upnp.forward`. 
2. Determine the network driver / type used (supports `bridge`, `host`, `macvlan` and `ipvlan`).
3. Connects to the internet gateway from that network (so the gateway allows it) 
4. Sends UPnp port forwarding rules specified.
5. Repeat after the specified interval (default `15` seconds).


It's worth understanding that depending on the network driver, how port forwarding works is different:
* For `bridge` network driver (the default), traffic will be making a double hop, once from the internet gateway to the docker interface (controlled by the `portical.upnp.forward` label rule), then from the docker interface to 
the target container (controlled by the normal docker ports `-p` flag or `ports` yaml option).
* For `host`, `macvlan` or `ipvlan` network driver, traffic will only make a single hope from the 
internet gateway to the target container (and you will not be required to specify the `-p` flag or `ports` yaml option).

## TODO

* Support sigterm/sigkill
* Test more corner cases
